Accountability Framework

#Privacy Policy and Guidelines - PolimeterNP	

##What are we?

We are an ongoing project that aims to build an accountability framework which  informs Nepali citizens about their leaders/politicians. We aspire to become a go-to portal for any profiling tasks of Politicians, Voters approach to research regarding any kinds of elections and commitment tracker reflected in personal as well as party manifesto of politicians. 

Since PolimeterNP has been operated as a crowd sourced program, we are sensitive about the issues this may give rise in the future. An Open Source Tech + Political project is prone to be tampered with a lot of legal and technical issues. The rising concerns of Data collection strategy and volunteer’s integrity maintenance is addressed by this policy handbook. This document is highly referenced and is in compliance with General Data Protection Regulation (2016/679) (GDPR). 

##Privacy Roadmap 

Polimeter NP should be developed and maintained for years by different group of interested individuals. We respect the privacy of all individuals and institutions directly or indirectly connected to us. Our Privacy Policy explains the following basic elements:
 
* What information we collect and why we collect it. 
* How we use that information. 

##What information we collect and why we collect it? 

As a structural part of the project, we collect information about all political parties, their manifestos and politicians under their wings and umbrella associations. The information can be of political or personal nature but we will make sure to safeguard its publication if it has not been made public prior to this project or if the information source is unreliable.

About the volunteers who are ready to contribute and commit, we collect information about their expertise, commits and contributions. Some personal information is collected to make them comfortable working in a group but they won’t be made public or provided to other third parties without their consent. 

##How we use information we collect?

The information we collect on public figures will be used to make the PolimeterNP portal more efficient and informative. We make sure to refer to reliable sources of data so no misinterpretation can be done to the political motives of politicians and volunteers.
Merge requests and branches on the main portal will be reviewed by a team of professionals appointed by the core team and can reject the data or commits from unreliable sources.  

The information about volunteers will be use strictly for the allocation of tasks and team. No personal information is to be publicly disclosed against the wish of volunteers themselves.
